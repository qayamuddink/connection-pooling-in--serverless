# Connection Pooling in Serverless Environments

This repository demonstrates how to set up and use connection pooling with Prisma in a serverless environment. It focuses on the use of Prisma Accelerate to manage database connections efficiently, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.

## Overview

Connection pooling is a technique that allows multiple database connections to be reused by various clients, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections for each request. This is particularly important in serverless environments where the number of instances can scale rapidly, potentially overwhelming the database with connection requests.

## Features

- Centralized connection management
- Efficient resource utilization
- Controlled concurrency
- Improved performance
- Scalability
